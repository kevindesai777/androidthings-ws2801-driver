androidthings-ws2801-driver
---------------------------

This repo contains the Android Things driver to control an LED strip based on the WS2801 chip (and should work on similar LED strips as long as the protocol is the same).

The driver can be found in the `ws2801-driver` module and there's a demo app showing how to use the driver in the `demo-app` module.

Only tested with a Raspberry Pi 3 but should work in more devices.

Schematics as shown in https://github.com/androidthings/drivers-samples/blob/master/apa102/rpi3_schematics.png
